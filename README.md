# TalkAI Frontend

TalkAI is a modern, feature-rich web application built with React and TypeScript, leveraging Vite as its build tool for optimal development experience and performance. This sophisticated platform combines real-time communication capabilities with advanced AI features, creating an intuitive and responsive chat interface that adapts to user preferences and needs.

The application is architected using modern web development practices, implementing a component-based structure with React for efficient UI rendering and state management. It utilizes TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience, while incorporating various contemporary web APIs for features like audio recording and real-time communication. The frontend is built with a focus on modularity and scalability, employing custom hooks and context providers for state management and feature encapsulation.

One of the standout features of TalkAI is its comprehensive internationalization system, supporting multiple languages (currently English and Turkish) with dynamic content translation capabilities. The platform also implements a sophisticated theming system that not only supports light and dark modes but also adapts to user preferences and system settings. The authentication system provides secure user access management with features including registration, login, and password reset functionalities.

The chat system, which forms the core of the application, is built with real-time communication in mind. It integrates with various AI APIs including speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, enabling users to interact with the system through both text and voice interfaces. The application also features a robust notification system for real-time alerts and user activity tracking, ensuring users stay informed of important updates and system events.

Looking ahead, TalkAI is set to expand its capabilities with planned features including Stripe payment integration for subscription management, enhanced mobile responsiveness, and an extended profile system. The application's modular architecture and strong technical foundation make it well-positioned for these future enhancements while maintaining its current performance and user experience standards.
